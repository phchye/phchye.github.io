SOUL SLASHER SAYAKA is a 2D action platformer developed by Seven Foxes. The game is set in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, where demons known as 'youkai' have invaded the human realm, leaving death and destruction in their wake. Join Sayaka and Mikazuki in their fight against the endless hordes, pushing deeper and deeper into the heart of the demon capital where the Greater Demons await!
